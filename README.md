# Property Analysis

For this project, I
- scrape the list of properties from remax-malta.com
- clean the data
- perform basic explanatory data analysis
- apply machine learning techniques (catboost & linear regression)
- deploy the results and prediction in a simple webpage which can be found [here](http://dylanzam.pythonanywhere.com/)

Visualizations including HTML and CSS are done using plotly's Dash library.
